ToggleHiddenFiles.app
=====================
This is a simple App created using AppleScript commands. This app is intended to be used as a button docked in the toolbar inside a Finder window.

Note: It is currently not signed by a developer, so if you have Gatekeeper running (as you should) you will see a warning when you try to run it via double-clicking the app. 

##To use the app:
1. Download the App to your machine by either cloning or simply downloading the ZIP (stick it wherever you want, likely the Applications directory)
2. Right-click on the app and select open, at the prompt confirm that you want to open the app.
3. To add the app to your Finder toolbar, hold the Command button while dragging the app to the Finder toolbar

When using the toggle feature of the app, the Finder App will be restarted. 
TODO: There may be ways around this or at least to open in the smae directory location you were in prior to restarting Finder.
